Problem 04 - Largest palindrome product
state: Solved
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Q: Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
